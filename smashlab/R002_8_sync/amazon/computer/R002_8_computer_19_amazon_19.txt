Cutting the dressing to a size a little bit bigger than the wood. Yeah, sticking it on, taking the covering on the wound, and now I'm going to take over top of that feeling. Back off the tape. It probably should have cut the tape a little bit shorter and I'm applying the tape over the bandage, although all of the steps are complete. Thank you for your participation.Cutting the dressing to a size a little bit bigger than the wood .
